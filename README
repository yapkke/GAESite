The era of hosting your own site and running your own machines is
pretty much past.  Everything is "cloud" now.  So, why not my personal
website?  Afterall, I can possibly have a much more available personal
site as a result.

To "cloud" my personal site, I used Google App Engine and Spreadsheet
in Google Docs.  In fact, I host most of the files I want to share on
Google Docs too.  So ideally, Google works hard to maintain my
personal site's availability.  Not bad?

Here's the code I used for my site.  It is damn boring... I know.  But
I hacked it together real fast and I am a graduate student.  Use it as
starter code or for your own site if you want.
